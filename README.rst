This page collects files and computer code for the paper **Solving the Income Fluctuation Problem with Unbounded Rewards** by Huiyu Li and John Stachurski.



Abstract
----------

This paper studies the income fluctuation problem without imposing bounds
on utility, assets, income or consumption. We prove that the
Coleman operator is a contraction mapping over the natural class of
candidate consumption policies when endowed with a metric that evaluates
consumption differences in terms of marginal utility.  We
show that this metric is complete, and that the fixed point of the operator
coincides with the unique optimal policy.  As a consequence, 
even in this unbounded setting, policy function iteration
always converges to the optimal policy at a geometric rate.
